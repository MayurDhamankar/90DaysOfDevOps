90-Day Learning Plan

I am currently working as a Cloud Engineer. Over the next 90 days, my goal is to build a strong foundation in DevOps by practicing core-level concepts and gaining clarity on the basics — understanding not only how tools work, but also why we use them.

My plan is to first strengthen my knowledge of essential DevOps tools and concepts. Once I gain confidence and hands-on experience, I will gradually implement best practices in our production environment. This structured approach will help me deepen my knowledge and begin my DevOps specialization journey with clarity and confidence.

Initial Focus Areas:

Docker

Kubernetes (K8s)

AWS core services (ECS, EKS, ECR)

Time Allocation:

1–1.5 hours per day on weekdays

5–7 hours on weekends

This consistent learning schedule will help me systematically build expertise and practical skills in DevOps.
